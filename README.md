But wait... there's more!

- _The best test setup:_ Automatically guarantee code quality and non-breaking
  changes. (Seen a react app with 100% test coverage before?)
- _Native web app:_ Your app's new home? The home screen of your users' phones.
- _The fastest fonts:_ Say goodbye to vacant text.
- _Stay fast_: Profile your app's performance from the comfort of your command
  line!
- _Catch problems:_ AppVeyor and TravisCI setups included by default, so your
  tests get run automatically on Windows and Unix.

Thereâ€™s also a <a href="https://vimeo.com/168648012">fantastic video</a> on how to structure your React.js apps with scalability in mind. It provides rationale for the majority of boilerplate's design decisions.
